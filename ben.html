        Life is all about the simple things that fill your heart with love, right? For the kind people at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery, it most certainly is. This animal welfare organization truly cares about these young animals, even before they are born.
    <br>
    Six of the seven species of sea turtles are now in risk of extinction. The majority of it results from the exploitation of natural resources by humans. Thankfully, this hatchery has accepted responsibility for their protection. Beginning with watching over the nesting mother turtles, they next transport their eggs to the safe environment of the hatchery and, on the day of birth, release the young turtles into the sea. If there are problems, they tend to them and only release them when they are well enough to enter the huge ocean.
    <br><br>
    All five of the country's species can be found making their nests at Kosgoda, one of the relatively few hatcheries. They are the Hawksbill, Leatherback, Green, and Olive Ridley turtles.
    <br><br>
    Don't forget to ask our staff, if you could experience the rewarding feeling of releasing some of these delicate creatures to the ocean on your visit! The innocent souls come flapping back the first two-three times the wave hits them. But, after that they flap into their homes; the ocean, with so much joy, it fills up your heart too!

        <h2>Turtle Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <h3>The steps taken by the hatchery are as follows:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Nest Protection: By moving turtle nests to a secure location, the hatchery locates and guards turtle nests. Predation, disturbance by people, and erosion-related harm are all reduced as a result.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Incubation of eggs is done in a controlled atmosphere at a hatchery that gathers eggs from nests that are at risk. When compared to letting them go into the wild, this increases the likelihood of survival.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Release of Hatchlings: The hatchery facilitates the safe release of the hatchlings into the ocean as they leave their eggs. To reduce their exposure to predators and increase their chances of survival, they are released at night.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Rehabilitative care: Sick or injured turtles are saved and transported to the hatchery for rehabilitational care. Until they are well enough to be released back into the wild, the hatchery offers a safe environment for their recuperation.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Public Awareness and Education: To promote public understanding of turtle protection, the hatchery holds workshops, educational events, and tours. Visitors learn the value of safeguarding turtles and their habitats as well as the dangers they face.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Conservation of Nesting Beaches: The hatchery works with regional government agencies and local communities to put protections in place for nesting beaches. Campaigns to clean up beaches, the creation of protected areas, and the enforcement of laws prohibiting hazardous activities are a few examples of this.
                </li>
             
            </ul>
