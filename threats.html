<h2>Threats for Turtles</h2>
        
         
            <p> Sea turtles are strong and durable. Since the time of the dinosaurs, they have swum the waters, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. However, in recent times, due to the quickly expanding human population, there have been new, intense pressures that have made it harder for sea turtles to survive. The IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group's expert members have identified five primary risks affecting sea turtles throughout the world: Bycatch in fisheries, coastal development, diseases and pollution, direct take, and climate change</p>
        
            <h3>Main Threats for Turtles</h3>
        </div>
            
    <ol>
        <div class="section">
        <li><h3><b>Global Warming</b></h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sea turtles and other species are suffering greatly as a result of global warming. Animals are unable to withstand such drastic climatic changes naturally due to the rate of global warming. The loss of beach and sea turtle nesting habitat is already a result of sea level rise brought on by polar ice melting. Climate change-related weather extremes include increasingly frequent and powerful storms that disrupt breeding beaches, erode beaches, and inundate or flood sea turtle eggs.</li>
       <br><br>
            <li>Lower hatching rates or complete nest failure are caused by hotter sand from rising temperatures. Increased sand temperatures also change the normal sex ratios of hatchlings, with hotter temperatures resulting in a greater proportion of female hatchlings. According to a recent Australian research, female green sea turtles made up 99.9% of the population at Raine Island. </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>To move about and hunt for prey, sea turtles rely on ocean currents. By changing currents and having an impact on the distribution and quantity of prey species, warming ocean temperatures have an impact on migratory species. This may lead to the discovery of southern species way outside of their typical distribution in more northerly places. As a result of coral bleaching, warmer water temperatures also have an impact on coral reefs, which are essential to the survival of species like the hawksbill.</li>

            <div class="section">
        <li><h3><b>Ocean Plastic</b></h3></li>
        <img src="plastic+and+sea+turtles.jpg" alt="threats">
        <ul>
            <li>Plastic has an impact on sea turtles at every stage of development. When they are hatchlings, they crawl through plastic to go to the ocean; when they migrate, they swim through it; when they do, they mistake it for jellyfish, one of their favorite diets; and when they are adults, they crawl back through it. Each year, ocean pollution and ingestion or entanglement in marine debris cause the deaths of thousands of sea turtles, whales, and other marine mammals, as well as more than 1 million seabirds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><b><u>FIVE WAYS PLASTIC AFFECTS SEA TURTLES</u></b></h4>
        <img src="plastic+on+a+nesting+beach.jpg" alt="threats">
        <ul>
            <li>Plastic bags can be mistaken for jellyfish by sea turtles. In the water, a turtle cannot distinguish between the two and will frequently consume the bag, which gets lodged in their stomach.</li>
        <li> Junk on beaches where birds nest. In many locations, adult sea turtles must rummage through accumulated trash to locate a site to nest, and hatchlings might become entangled in the material while attempting to reach the ocean. The smallest pieces of plastic in the sand can potentially harm nests and young animals. </li>
        <li> They risk becoming trapped in it while swimming. Long turtle migrations often take them through regions with a lot of ocean trash. They may become entangled in objects like six-pack rings or abandoned fishing equipment.</li>
        <li>Helium-filled Mylar balloons may also take on the appearance of jellyfish. These balloons have a range of hundreds of miles and may land in the ocean or rivers.  </li>
        <li>Microplastic may end up in their meals. Small pieces of plastic that are eaten by fish or other creatures can later be digested by turtles (and humans).</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="section">
        <li><h3><b>Ocean Pollution</b></h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>At every stage of development, from eggs to hatchlings to adolescents to adults, sea turtles are susceptible to ocean pollution. Toxic metals, PCBs, petroleum products, and agricultural and industrial runoff of contaminants such fertilizers, chemicals, nutrients, and untreated garbage are all examples of pollutants. Through direct contact, pollutants may affect sea turtles right away, or they may accumulate in tissues over time and promote immunosuppression, which can culminate in illness and death. </li>
        <li> Pollution also poses a concern and has the potential to affect broad regions of sea turtle habitat degradation. The locations where offshore oil development and production are most likely to have an impact share habitat with sea turtles. Oil pollution results from spills, runoff from land-based sources, offshore oil exploration and production, transportation of oil products, deliberate discharge from vessels, and vessel groundings. </li>
       <li> When oil spills occur far offshore, they tend to concentrate in convergence zones, which are crucial places for the growth of juvenile turtles. Additionally, oil from offshore spills washes up on beaches, deteriorating the environment for breeding birds. This has an effect on nests, nesting females, and hatchlings finding their way to the ocean.</li>
    <li> Food tainted with oil or tar balls has an impact on sea turtles as well. When crude oil that is dissolved in water degrades, tar balls develop. When the stomach contents of deceased hatchlings were inspected, tar balls were found in a significant portion of them. </li>

<div class="section">
<li><h3><b>Fisheries Bycatch</b></h3></li>
<ul>
    <li>Bycatch, often known as incidental capture in fishing gear, is most certainly the biggest danger to sea turtles and many other species globally. In the fishing industry, almost 40% of all creatures are thrown away as garbage. Sea turtles, seabirds, marine mammals, and other animals are trapped and dumpedâ€”usually dead. It is uncertain what will happen to animals who are captured and released while still alive and damaged.</li>
    <li>Marine life is killed via accidental entanglement or capture as a result of trawls, longlines, driftnets, gillnets, pots, and traps. Many animals and fish that aren't supposed to be caught become entangled in longlines, which include thousands of baited hooks on lines that can be tens of miles long.  Sea turtles, especially green, loggerhead, olive ridley, and leatherback varieties, as well as seabirds like albatrosses are drawn to the bait and end up getting hooked up on the hooks or drowning after becoming tangled in the lines. </li>
<li> Furthermore harmful, trawls are thought to capture 20 pounds of bycatch for every pound of target fish. Although there are no international regulations on turtle excluder devices, they have decreased sea turtle mortality in trawl fisheries.
