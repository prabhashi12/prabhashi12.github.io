        Life is all about the simple things that fill your heart with love, right? For the kind people at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery, it most certainly is. This animal welfare organization truly cares about these young animals, even before they are born.
    <br>
    Six of the seven species of sea turtles are now in risk of extinction. The majority of it results from the exploitation of natural resources by humans. Thankfully, this hatchery has accepted responsibility for their protection. Beginning with watching over the nesting mother turtles, they next transport their eggs to the safe environment of the hatchery and, on the day of birth, release the young turtles into the sea. If there are problems, they tend to them and only release them when they are well enough to enter the huge ocean.
    <br><br>
    All five of the country's species can be found making their nests at Kosgoda, one of the relatively few hatcheries. They are the Hawksbill, Leatherback, Green, and Olive Ridley turtles.
    <br><br>
    Don't forget to ask our staff, if you could experience the rewarding feeling of releasing some of these delicate creatures to the ocean on your visit! The innocent souls come flapping back the first two-three times the wave hits them. But, after that they flap into their homes; the ocean, with so much joy, it fills up your heart too!

        Sri Lanka's Role in Turtle Conservation: The Kosgoda Turtle Care
One of 18 turtle hatcheries along Sri Lanka's southern coast is the Turtle Care Center at Kosgoda Beach. The center was founded in 1981 and is situated in the beach community of Kosgoda in South Western Australia. Additionally, Kosgoda serves as the nesting ground for all five species of turtles that come to Sri Lanka. This is not the case with many of the other island-area hatcheries, where just some of the species are present on the beaches.
      <br>
      The facility primarily serves as a hatchery and makes great efforts to boost the rate of hatching and survival of young turtles. However, the Care Center also treats and releases sick or injured persons back into the ocean after treating them. They also organize awareness campaigns for both domestic and foreign tourists and volunteer initiatives.

        <h3>The steps taken by the hatchery are as follows:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The staff searches the beach at night for female sea turtles that emerge from the water to lay eggs.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Until the mother has finished laying the eggs and has returned to the ocean, they guard the mother from a distance while she is in the nesting stage.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    To keep the eggs safe from predators and careless human behavior, the eggs are moved from the beach to the hatchery.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Fishermen are additionally compensated for bringing any turtle eggs they locate to the hatchery.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    In a safe environment, the eggs grow and hatch. It can take 45 to 60 days to complete.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    If there are no issues, the newly hatched turtles are released into the water that same day. This is done in an effort to limit human influence on their way of life as much as possible.
                </li>
              
            </ul>
