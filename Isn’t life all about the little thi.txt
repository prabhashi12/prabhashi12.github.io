Isn’t life all about the little things that take up all your heart? Well, it definitely is, for the good folks at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. Here’s a welfare center that genuinely cares about these little creatures, even before they’re born.

Today, six out of the seven species of sea turtles are endangered. And most of it is because of human exploitation of natural resources. Thankfully, this hatchery has taken the onus to protect them. They start with keeping an eye on the nesting mother turtles, bringing their eggs to the secure environment of the hatchery and finally releasing the baby turtles into the sea on the day of their birth. However, if there are complications, they tend to them and release them only once they’re fit to go into the vast ocean.

Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species in the country make their nests. They are the Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads and Hawksbills.

Don't forget to ask our staff, if you could experience the rewarding feeling of releasing some of these delicate creatures to the ocean on your visit! The innocent souls come flapping back the first two-three times the wave hits them. But, after that they flap into their homes; the ocean, with so much joy, it fills up your heart too!

The Kosgoda Turtle Care – Sri Lanka’s Part in Turtle Conservation
The Turtle Care Centre at Kosgoda beach is one of 18 turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of Sri Lanka. The centre is located in the South Western coastal village of Kosgoda and was establised in 1981. It is also very popular as all five species of turtles that visit Sri Lanka nest in Kosgoda. This is not so with many of the other hatcheries around the island whose beaches host only some of the species.

The centre functions mainly as a hatchery and makes huge efforts to increase the rate of hatching, and survival of baby turtles in their very initial stages. However the Care centre also works on sick or injured adults; treating them and releasing them back into the ocean. They also run volunteer programs and awareness programs for local and international visitors.

The hatchery works in the following steps:
Staff patrols beach at nights looking for mother sea turtles that come out of the sea to lay eggs.
They protect the mother from afar during the nesting process, until she finishes laying the eggs and returns to the ocean.
The eggs are relocated from beach to hatchery to protect them from predators and irresponsible human action.
In addition fishermen are also paid to bring any turtle eggs they find to the hatchery.
The eggs develop and hatch in a protected area. This may take between 45-60 days.
The hatched turtles are released into the ocean on the same day if no complications arise. This is to avoid human interference in their lifestyles as much as possible.
The Kosgoda Turtle Care centre is a great place to learn and love nature while also having fun. It is hands-on and family friendly and therefore should definitely be visited on your holiday to Sri Lanka.Enjoy visiting the Kosgoda Turtle Care Centre as part of Lakpura’s South Seas tour experience.

Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonii. Therefore they are also called chelonians by researchers and conservationists. Chelonians are charaterized by the special bony shell or carapace, which is developed from their ribs and acts as a shield. They are an old group with the very first proto-turtles having evolved over 220 milliom years ago in the Triassic Era. The order of Chelonii, also known as the Testudines, have three members in the group; turtles, tortoises and terrapins.

Turtles: In North America the word indicates all chelonians, including tortoises and terrapins. However in the UK the turtle indicates sea dwelling species of Chelonians. The word generally refers to chelonians with flippers that spend the major portion of their lives in water.

Tortoises: The word refers to land dwelling, non-swimming chelonians. They have legs and feet, as opposed to the flippers of the other members of the group.

Terrapin: Terrapin is a word referring to several species of small, edible, hard shelled turtles that spend their lives in brackish water.
